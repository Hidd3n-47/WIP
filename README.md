# WIP - Zombie Labs
 Group Project where we create a zombie survival game where each round loads up a random level and challenge. The player then needs to surivve and complete the challenge to unlock a perk.

 Programmers:
  Christian: Engine work and game feedback such as animation, bullet impact, sound.
  Isaac: Player
  John: Level
